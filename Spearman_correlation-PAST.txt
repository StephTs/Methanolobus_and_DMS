After extracting the PCoA scores during the microeco analysis of the mcrA sequencing results (see "mcrA_analysis-microeco.R"), 
I created an excel file that contained sample information and information on environmental parameters: sampling depth,
total DMS degradation of the incubated samples, total methane and CO2 production, methane in situ, starting sulfate in the incubations 
and sulfate at the end of the incubations (see "Baltic_mcrA_PCoA_scores.csv").

Once the table was created, it was copied into PAST, with the sample information being in the "Name" column and PCo1 in column A, Pco2 in B etc.
All data were selected and in the PAST menu I clicked on "Univariate --> Correlation" and specified in the Correlation table that I was interested in Spearman's rs.
In the "Table format" I used both "Permutation p" and "Statistic" and copied both tables into excel.

Continuing in excel, I created a table coontaining the first two PCoA scores and their Spearman's rank correlation result against each environmental parameter.
The "Permutaton p" was included as an asterisk next to the correlation result.
