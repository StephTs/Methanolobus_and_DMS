# _Methanolobus_ and DMS
Code for the paper:
xxxx with enbedded link

This repo contains the code for analysing the amplicon data presented in the paper using QIIME2 as well as code for creating a custom _mcrA_ database. Furthermore, it has R scripts detailing the bioinformatic analysis of the amplicon data and how the various graphs were made using ggplot2. Lastly, program usage information is given for ArcGIS (used to create the sampling map) and PAST (used for the Spearman correlation analysis).

Any help with improving the above scripts or any other comments are greatly appreciated.  


## Content
1) xx script - qiime2 analysis of _mcrA_ sequences from the Baltic Sea samples
2) xx csv - metadata file of Baltic Sea _mcrA_ samples
3) xx script - creating an _mcrA_ database
4) ggplot2 script - script containing information on the creation of all R graphs (avg gases, metag/T heatmap, qPCR, PCoA) and mention relative abundance graph was made on excel
5) Step-by-step usage information for ArcGIS map making
6) Step-by-step usage of PAST for the Spearman analysis 
7) License text or md - I think cc-by-4.0 is best one
