Code for the paper:
xxxx with enbedded link

This repo contains the code for analysing the amplicon data presented in the paper using QIIME2 as well as code for creating a custom _mcrA_ database. Furthermore, it has R scripts detailing the bioinformtaic analysis of the amplicon data and how the various graphs were made using ggplot2. Lastly, program usage information is given for ArcGIS (used to create the sampling map) and PAST (used for the Spearman correlation analysis).

I am not a bioinformatician and writing the above scripts was my first attempt of coding so any help with my scripts or any other comments are greatly appreciated.
